With this project you will build a painter app and draw whatever you want on the OLED display

Use the potentiometer to access the setting on the LCD screen and choose between pen, spray or erase!

With the pushbuttons you can control the pen, spray or eraser up, down, left and right!

Enjoy drawing!
